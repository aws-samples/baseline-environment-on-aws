# Migrate BLEA Standalone to BLEA Multi-Account

[View this page in Japanese (日本語)](Standalone2ControlTower_ja.md) | [Back to README](../README.md)

You can enroll an AWS account managed by Baseline Environment on AWS(Standalone) into OU managed by Control Tower with BLEA Multi-Account. Guest Base and Guest System on the enroll account are not changed, but the systems may be affected by Organizations Service Control Policies (SCPs) after enrollment. So we recommend to test the SCPs before enrollment.

On this procedure, we named accounts listed below:

- Management account: an account setup Baseline Environment on AWS (Multi-Account) with Control Tower
- Target account: an account setup Baseline Environment on AWS (Standalone), will enroll into OU managed by Control Tower.
